		"Howdy, my name is Edder Uriostegui and I'm a Computer Science major attending The University of Houston Downtown! 
		I am in my last semester, and I'm looking to acquire more internship experience and perhaps join as a Software Engineer for anyone who is willing to give me a job! 
		I enjoy playing videos with my dog, Gizmo, playing violin, and going to the gym. Overall my interests in video lie with rouge-likes such as Dead Cells. 
		My dog is an English bull terrier that loves to sleep and wrestle. I have a background in Electrical/Computer engineering as I was originally majoring in that field. I enjoy tinkering with electronics as well. 
		I’m also a peripheral enthusiast as I follow and learn a ton about monitors and tvs especially the new displays on the market! My summer internship lies with Geospace, a seismic instrumentation company that is contracted and creates their own proprietary instruments to sell to companies.
		Geospace has many companies that handle various areas of research use cases from designing to oil field. With companies encompassing it from Aquana to Quantum. My purpose was to design internal applications as their sole software engineering intern. I learned a ton about areas pertaining to networking and more seismic engineering. 
		Interacting with various concentration that encompasses engineering pertaining to mechanical engineering and electrical engineering. "
