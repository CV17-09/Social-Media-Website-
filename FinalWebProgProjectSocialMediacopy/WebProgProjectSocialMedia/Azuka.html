    My name is Azuka and I am taking this course to graduate for my computer science degree this fall. I am currently taking this as a W course and am eager to find out what I can write a report about. The other course I am taking is CS 4318 which is about database systems. After I graduate I hope to find a good paying and stress free job. For personal hobbies, I love to play video games, play basketball and learn about computers and other technology. Besides that I don’t really have 200 words that I can come up with at the moment so I guess this will just be it.
